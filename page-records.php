        <h3>MRTC Local Road Race Records</h3>

        <p>Memphis Area Road Race Records are recorded and published as "MRTC Local Race Records". This information contains records set for MRTC measured courses or USATF Certified courses in the Memphis Area. To be eligile for "MRTC Local Race Records", you must be legitimately entered in the race and must be a local resident of the Memphis area.</p>

        <p>As of Jan. 1, 2004, if you are not a local resident but support MRTC by being a member, you will also be eligible to be in "MRTC Local Race Records". "All-Time" records that have been previously recorded in "MRTC Local Race Records" (before Jan. 1, 2004) by non-local, non-MRTC members, will be allowed to remain until said record is broken.</p>

        <p>"MRTC Local Race Records" was started in 1998 by Paul Ireland and was taken over by Rachel Ragan in 2002. In April of 2004, Vince Perryman took it over and on Jan.1, 2005 Rachel Ragan took it back. On August 31, 2005 John Payne took it. In February, 2009, Rachel Ragan took it again, and later in 2009, Olaf Schulz took it.  Terry Connell took it September, 2011.</p>

        <p>Starting in 2005 we added the Senior Master category.</p>

        <p>If you see any errors or discrepencies in any of these records (including misspelled names, incorrect ages or the reporting of non-local, non MRTC-members record holders after Jan. 1, 2004), please contact Terry Connell at terry.connell@gmail.com.</p>

        <p>"All-Time Record"   means a person has held that record from Jan. 1, 1998 through the latest records update, except for 1-Mile records, which started in 2004 and half marathon records, which started in 2002.</p>

        <p>All Memphis Area races which contract with the MRTC for services must certify their race course with MRTC. MRTC certified race courses are accurate in measurement and hold the same standards as do USATF certified courses. If any changes to the course are made after MRTC certification, the certification becomes void and must be re-certified. Refer to the MRTC Event Contract form for certification information.</p>
